      <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard language used to create and design web pages on the internet. It was introduced by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991 at CERN as a simple markup language. Since then, it has evolved through versions from HTML 2.0 to HTML5 (the latest 2024 version).

HTML is a combination of Hypertext and Markup language. Hypertext defines the link between the web pages and Markup language defines the text document within the tag.</p>

      <p>CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a language used to style and enhance websites. It controls how HTML elements—such as text, images, and buttons—are displayed on a webpage. With CSS, you can adjust font sizes and colors, add backgrounds, and manage the layout, transforming a basic webpage into a visually appealing and user-friendly experience. CSS also simplifies layout management across multiple web pages by using external stylesheets stored in CSS files.</p>
